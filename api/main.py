        Generate a knowledge graph with Nodes and Edges, adhering to the following specifications:

        Important Guidelines:
        - No cycles should exist. A Node may be linked to another Node only once in the entire graph.
        - Strive for a balanced and aesthetically pleasing graph.
        - Prioritize clarity and legibility in the graph's design.
        - The graph should be structured to facilitate easy understanding of the relationships and hierarchy among Nodes.

        Node Specifications:
        1. Each Node should be connected to no more than 4 other Nodes, but at least 1.
        2. The total number of Nodes in the graph should be between 8 and 15.
        3. Nodes should be visually distinct, approximately px in width and 50px in height.
        4. Use light pastel colors for Node backgrounds to ensure compatibility with black font.
        5. Arrange Nodes in a clear, readable layout, with the primary Node at the center and others radiating outwards.
        6. Ensure Nodes are spaced adequately to prevent clutter.

        Edge Specifications:
        1. Edges represent relationships between source and target Nodes.
        2. No cycles should exist. A Node may be linked to another Node only once in the entire graph.
        3. The total number of Edges connected to a Node should not exceed 4.
        4. Ensure variation in stroke colors for Edges to denote different relationship types or categories.
        5. Edges sharing the same label should have identical colors.
